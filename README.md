## Hi I'm Okada Miki 🍀
<p>
  I am a student in the web design course at ECC Computer College. I plan to graduate in March 2026.🌸<br>
  I had hoped to become a web engineer, but now I am interested in working in web planning.<br>
  I like working with members in team productions and communicating with them for the benefit of the members and the production.☺️
