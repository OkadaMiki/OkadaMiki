<h1>Hi I'm Okada Miki 🍀</h1>
<p>
  🌸 I am a student in the Web Design course at ECC Computer College. I plan to graduate in March 2026.<br>
  💪 I am aiming to become a front-end engineer, but I am also interested in working in web planning.<br>
  🤝 I communicate a lot with members of the team so that we can create better products as a team.<br>
  ☺️ I also try to properly understand the client's intentions for the quality of the production.
